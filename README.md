# Influenza

The Temporary Staffing Agency located in the United States has requested to determine the need for additional medical employees in Healthcare institutions (Hospitals, Clinics) during the upcoming Influenza season. Based on historical data find out when and where to send temporary frontline staff to insure smooth operations and decrease the pressure on the Healthcare system.


***Objectives:***

Determine the amount of staff for each US state.
***Scope of Work:***

The agencies which provide temporary workforce operate in hospitals in all 50 US states, and the
effort will prepare for the forthcoming influenza season which is normally taking place from November
until March (may slightly vary from state to state) with its pick in December-January each year.
Research Hypothesis:
***Null Hypothesis:*** If the state has more inhabitants who belong to vulnerable groups (children under 5
years old and elderly people 65+), then mortality rates will be higher.
***Alternative Hypothesis:*** If the state has more inhabitants who belong to vulnerable groups (children
under 5 years old and elderly people 65+), then there will be no influence on mortality rates.
The assumption is that the amount of the population which is considered a risk - group has an
influence on the mortality rate as influenza spreads from person to person via airborne throughout
the contacts and these segments are the most sensitive due to health reasons. The group “under 5
years old” and “Seniors 65+“were chosen as one of the most vulnerable segments.
